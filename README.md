Welcome to the File Come process

This process will take all the output files for various use cases in a given month and combine it all.
This is to make the dashboard process easier by having to combine a small selection of files instead of a file for each individual day.

1. You will be able to select individual use cases to combine or all at once
2. You will also be able to specify the month and year you wish to combine for each use case
3. The process is setup to be expanded to different use cases with most of the work coming from updating the mappings dictionary
4. The process will evaluate the retrieval descriptions provided by the output reports and assign a business status (Sucess or exception). 
It will also provide clarity as to the scenario of that outcome
